GoogleMapApp
============

This app was made to make geolocation with some address in a Database, this was my first time using JSP and JEE technologies. Given an address it checks if this address exists or not in the DB records and if it does exist then it updates the map location with the address given.

this app was made using, 

JSP, Java, HTML, CSS, JQuery, SQLServer and Google Maps JavaScript API.
